# Blog site


![Site snapshot](./public/assets/Blog-site-snapshot.webp)

The project features a full-stack blog site with a focus on the create, read, update and delete [CRUD] functionality. 

Uses React (vite with rollup), react-router, react-hook-form, and tailwind (with daisyui) on the frontend and utilizes firebase for storage.
The site is responsive and is based on the wireframe theming (colors are a pain) to keep it minimal.
